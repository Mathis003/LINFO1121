## Overview

This repository is a compilation of my solutions to the programming exercises in the LINFO1121 course at UCLouvain.
The exercises cover various topics in algorithms and are implemented in Java.

You can find the exercise guidelines [here](https://inginious.info.ucl.ac.be/course/LINFO1121).

I hope that this repository serves as a valuable resource for others navigating the complexities of algorithmic problem-solving in LINFO1121.
